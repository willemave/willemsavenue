Strange that my first list of 10 ideas was Pretty directly rooted in my day-to-day work and or life. I wonder if this will change over time.

1. Tile flooring for offices that has piezo electric motors in them so they can generate a small amount of electricity
2. Mats for your computer that has a buzzing timer so that you can know when 24 minutes of work have been up.
3. Mats that are slightly unstable so that you have to flex your muscles in order to stay standing, this would be great for back injuries.
4. Using your video camera to track head movements, two or three of these could map to commands such as go to chrome tab one.
5. Stacked shared communal gardens that are placed inside of city blocks, people could take shared ownership over some animals if they would prefer fresh eggs or the sort.
