Some more dumb ideas!

1. Play audio playlist tool that you could share your best childhood songs with your child at the relevant ages.
2. Auto remixer for the ADD economy, it would put together clips of music, and soundbites from CNN or podcasts that were interesting and play that in a 30 minute loop.
3. Headphones shaped like your ear but just looked a little bit bigger so that it looked like you had a giant ears.
4. Remote concerts that are streamed to live to your living room, and the visual/light show projected behind or around the band is controlled by a consensus algorithm between phone apps.
5. Free live stream concerts that are advertised on alcohol containers that you bring home like wine or beer.
