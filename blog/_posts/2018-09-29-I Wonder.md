"I wonder" are two of the most powerful words in the english language. It causes the brain to open doors. It inherently challenges assumptions. It forces different perspectives. It creates a perspective different from the status quo.

I wonder why that apple fell.

I wonder why the stars move.

I wonder why phones have key pads.

I wonder why touch devices need a stylus.

I wonder what a thought is.

I wonder what a self is...
