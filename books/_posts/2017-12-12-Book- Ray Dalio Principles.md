# [In Progress] Ray Dalio Principles

“Not knowing taught me more than knowing”

Do we have common principles? Are we clear about them? Do we write them down?

People can bootstrap their principles from Parents, Religion, etc. 

Ray’s Principles:

Q: Does social media provide a fuzzy look into peoples principles?
*“Strive for a lot and fail well - learn but don’t get knocked out“...“How do I know I’m right? Curiosity about why other peoples are different.”*

Sounds like Munger’s Mental Models, main focus of helping against inherent decision bias?

Mistakes:
*“Decision making is learned”* - disagree, there are many human biases that drive decision making. 
*“While everyone assumes the future is a modified version of the present, it most likely is not”*
*“Better make sense of other people, or other teams or places”...”Most everything has happened before for logical cause and effect reasons”*

Go really deep - Ray’s story about understanding the complete grain + meat + livestock map was super detailed. 

*“Always assume you’re missing something”* - we deal with lots of complex systems! Break things down into simpler Machines that you can model (chicken is a small machine that eats feed, so lock in feed future prices).

When you determine of you want, figure out the relative importance. 

Debate opinions with smart people with differing opinions.
Know when not to have an opinion
System wide principles

Change can only happen if you admit what you’re not good at. There is almost a good path in a case where you need two things and have to choose.
