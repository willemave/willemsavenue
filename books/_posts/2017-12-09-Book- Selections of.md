Language allows for passing down culture and knowledge and therefore ‘time binding’, it is a function of the brain, as in derived from language. Limitations of language (representations), all statements probable in varying degrees. 
Generalizations on civilization started with insufficient data (animal behaviors vs man behaviors). Infantilism still prevails, still primitive semantics, technology seems to accelerate these primitive behaviors.
