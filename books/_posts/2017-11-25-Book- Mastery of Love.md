# Mastery of Love

We are all masters, we all create personalities, create an image for others.  Whatever we believe comes true.  Anger - pushing problems away.  Action / Reaction.  Emotional body is full of wounds.  We live in continued fear of being hurt.  We create a big denial system.  Push buttons = pushing on wounds.  Education is just the domestication of humans, fear of not getting a reward.  We learn to pretend who we are not.  Image at home, image at school.  Man creates an image of the woman and vice versa.  

In the beginning we're tuned to explore, emotional system has an alarm system of fear.   We learn to be emotional based on environment. Sense of injustice i.e. If parents unfairly hurt you.  Before these you were completely healthy.  Loose innocence, slowly goes away.  We release emotional poison on other people.  We are always judging everyone, ourselves, I'm not good enough, etc.  We will never be perfect, never good enough, always something a judge will reject.  Only punishment only suffering.  No one in the whole world will abuse you more than yourself.  

You can't be responsibility for someone else's happiness.

But you will hardly remember 5% of your whole life.  You really don't know your mother, your mother doesn't really know you.  We have to respect everyone's dreams.  Every relationship is a living dream.  Track of love and Track of fear.  Love has no obligations, Fear is all obligations.  Love  is based on respect, fear is not.  Self pity comes from dis-respect.
