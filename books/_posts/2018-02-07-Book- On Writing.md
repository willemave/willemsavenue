#### The transaction 
No right way, but all need to commit you write, find the real man behind the angst of writing. Good writing is alive, humanity and warmth

#### Simplicity 
Cut to the essence. Think clearly, write clearly. Ask what am I trying to say, clarity is not accidental. 

#### Clutter
Prepositions and adjectives are usually silly. Clutter labors thought, confuses. IE “at this present time” vs “now”, “does it hurt?” Vs “experiencing any pain?”. 
How much as PC and social interaction blunted our communication.
Put brackets around word that do no work. Think deeply what do they add?

#### Style
Be yourself. Don’t be afraid of I, people want to hear about you. Say things with conviction, don’t be wishy-washy. Believe in your own opinions.

#### Audience
Write for yourself. Don’t imagine anyone else. Don’t worry if someone else will get it, if you want to add humor, add it. High quality craftsmanship. 

#### Words
Avoid Journalese, avoid cliches, “beef up”. Writing is not to be swift, but be original. Reverse the order of a sentence. Occasional short sentence. Add word with freshness or oddity.

#### Usage
Usage is relative. However be nuanced, “too” when substituted for “very” is clutter. Be liberal in new wordsmith but conservative in grammar. Separate usage form jargon, avoid the “noun turned verb”. 

#### Unity
All writing is ultimately solving a problem. Approach, attitude, style, which facts, or organization. Unity is the anchor, like which pronoun, tense, mood. Don’t let the material control you, establish unity. Key are “attitude” and “one point”, must reduce before your write. Can not chase all facts or points - identify the one area to bite off. Leave reader with one thought they did not have before. Reworking unity is ok, if new ideas come up. Writing has no respect for blueprints. 

#### Lead and Ending
Lead must force him to keep reading, humor, surprise, unusual idea, interesting fact, question. provide hard details. Every paragraph amplifies previous, add details. Periodic humor. Great leads pick out details or connections other people don’t notice. Avoid catch “one day” or “have in common”. Don’t end with a cliche, “to sum it up”. Good ending is slightly surprising, yet exactly right. 

#### Bits & Pieces
*Verbs*. Use active verbs. Passive voice likes longer Latin words, not precise Anglo words. Verbs push the sentence. Use precise verbs. 

*Adverbs*. Most are un-necessary. Strong verbs are weakened by adverbs. Same with adjectives. Don’t use Decidedly, Arguably, etc.

*Adjectives*. Also mostly un-necessary. Avoid adjective-by-habit. Use if it helps tell the story, or decision.

*Little Qualifiers*. Prune out small words that qualify how we feel, “a bit”, “a little”, “sort of”, “too”. Don’t hedge your prose, qualifiers whittle away fractions of readers trust — “what does he mean”?

*Punctuation*. Periods: Use them, break dissimilar thoughts into different sentences. Exclamation: Generally avoid, impact is best achieved by understatement. Semicolon: Dash and Period are better, abrupt, can be used to add related thoughts. Dash: Used to amplify first part, or two to add explanatory detail. Colon: Use before itemized lists. Mood Changers: (but, still, therefore, now,) Use them to re-orient readers. Contractions: Avoid ones that are ambiguous (I’d, he’d, we’d: had vs would). That and Which: Always use that unless it makes your meaning ambiguous, use which after a comma. Concept Nouns: Use them instead of impersonal nouns (“The common reaction is incredulous laughter” => “Most people just laugh with disbelief”) avoid abstract nouns. Creeping Nounism: “Nobody goes broke now; we have money problem areas” use fewer nouns. Overstatement: Don’t overstate, let humor sneak up. Credibility: it’s fragile, don’t abuse. Dictation: If you dictate, edit. Writing is not a contest: Write for you. Quickest Fix: simply get rid of the sentence. Paragraphs: Keep em short, *the unit is the paragraph not the sentence*. Rewriting: Writing is an evolving process, not a finish product - put yourself in the readers place - rewrite to insert variance, etc - reread with mind to previous sentences.


### Forms

#### Writing about People
Stories in peoples own words are powerful. Their words are always better then your words. 

#### Interviewing
Be prepared, take notes, do your homework. **Be a writer, write things down.** Don’t use a tape recorder, unless necessary.

#### Science and Technology
Describing how a process works is valuable for two reasons. It forces you to make sure you know how it works. Then it forces you to take the reader through the same sequence of ideas and deductions that made the process clear to you. Imagine science writing as an upside-down pyramid. Start at the bottom with the one fact a reader must know before he can learn any more. The second sentence broadens what was stated first. First fact can be small and relatable, doesn’t have to be groundbreaking. Reduce abstract principles to something that people can visualizE and relate.

#### Business Writing
clarity, simplicity, brevity and humanity. Avoid being pedantic and vague, avoid pompous generalizations. There is a deep yearning for human contact, don’t abstract it away in “business communications”. Avoid dead nouns like “capacity planning techniques” — what are capacity planning techniques? Whose capacity? By whom? If a customer has to stop and translate the sentence, you’ve failed. Actually a simple style is the result of hard work and hard thinking; a muddled style reflects a muddled thinker or a person too arrogant, or too dumb, or too lazy to organize his thoughts.

### Attitude
Don’t alter your voice to fit your subject. writer sounds confident; he’s not trying to ingratiate himself with the reader. Avoid breezy style, overly open, wordy, too “relatable” to the reader.
