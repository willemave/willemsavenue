<p>Some more dumb ideas!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Play audio playlist tool that you could share your best childhood songs with your child at the relevant ages.</li>
  <li>Auto remixer for the ADD economy, it would put together clips of music, and soundbites from CNN or podcasts that were interesting and play that in a 30 minute loop.</li>
  <li>Headphones shaped like your ear but just looked a little bit bigger so that it looked like you had a giant ears.</li>
  <li>Remote concerts that are streamed to live to your living room, and the visual/light show projected behind or around the band is controlled by a consensus algorithm between phone apps.</li>
  <li>Free live stream concerts that are advertised on alcohol containers that you bring home like wine or beer.</li>
</ol>
