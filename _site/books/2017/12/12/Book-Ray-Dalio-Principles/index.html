  <p>“Not knowing taught me more than knowing”</p>

<p>Do we have common principles? Are we clear about them? Do we write them down?</p>

<p>People can bootstrap their principles from Parents, Religion, etc.</p>

<p>Ray’s Principles:</p>

<p>Q: Does social media provide a fuzzy look into peoples principles?
<em>“Strive for a lot and fail well - learn but don’t get knocked out“…“How do I know I’m right? Curiosity about why other peoples views are different.”</em></p>

<p>Sounds like Munger’s Mental Models, main focus of helping adjust against inherent decision bias? Understanding multiple points of view before making a decision.</p>

<p>Mistakes:
<em>“Decision making is learned”</em> - Disagree, there are many human biases that drive decision making. Perhaps biases are learned as well though?
<em>“While everyone assumes the future is a modified version of the present, it most likely is not”</em>
<em>“Better make sense of other people, or other teams or places”…”Most everything has happened before for logical cause and effect reasons”</em></p>

<p>Go really deep - Ray’s story about understanding the complete grain + meat + livestock value chain and map was super detailed.</p>

<p><em>“Always assume you’re missing something”</em> We deal with lots of complex systems! Break things down into simpler machines that you can model (chicken is a small machine that eats feed, so lock in feed future prices).</p>

<p>When you determine what you want, figure out the relative importance of each option.</p>

<p>Debate opinions with smart people with differing opinions.
<strong>Know when not to have an opinion.</strong></p>

<p>Change can only happen if you admit what you’re not good at. When given a choice of two sub-optimal / hard things, there is almost always a better path, think hard about what that could be.</p>

<p>Best way to test your decisions is to write them down, try to lay them out algorithmically and backtest if possible.</p>

<p>If something is unusual, look deeper, likely something interesting there, correlate to previous knowledge and opinions.</p>

<p><em>“If you focus, work hard and are creative, you can have anything, but not everything.”</em></p>

<p>Be curious enough to understand what context causes people to see things differently than you.</p>

<p>*“Wise people stick to fundamentals during ups and downs.” * Best bet is to make a few uncorrelated bets.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put honest thoughts on table</li>
  <li>Have honest disagreements</li>
  <li>Honest ways to find out if disagreements still exist</li>
</ol>

<p>How do you break down mis-understanding between people in a group / team? Ray uses “Baseball cards”. Much of how we think is physiological, being stuck in ones head is dangerous.</p>

<p>Academic realms are based on consensus, however industry (like finance) are about beating odds.</p>

<p>Shapers: strong independent thinkers, understand all levels of stack from details to vision, test mental maps, wide array of vision either from themselves or others.</p>

<p>Heros: cause larger than themselves, shaped by battles and tests</p>
