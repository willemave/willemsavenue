I've always thought that about pages were a little strange, but here goes anyways.

My name is Willem Av√©. My wife is the amazing KJ. I currently work at Square as an engineering manager for two of our point-of-sale products.

I'm a cancer survivor. I love audio. I live in SF. I go to Burning Man, largely because it is such a wildly different environment and society than anything of come across in this world - it's a place where the sense of wonder is unlimited.
